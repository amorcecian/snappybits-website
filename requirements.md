# Build a complete, production-ready Next.js website for SnappyBits

## Overview
- **Keep** the existing logo and domain (`snappybits.com`). Also keep the colors.
- **Fully redesign** the site: fresh UI/UX, modern tech stack, best practices for performance and SEO.
- **Content structure** and copy should mirror the current pages (Home, Services, About, Contact), but refresh headlines and text to match a top-tier IT consulting brand.

## Tech & Architecture
1. **Framework:** Next.js (latest) + TypeScript  
2. **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + optional component library (e.g. shadcn/ui)  
3. **Deployment:** Vercel or AWS S3 + CloudFront  
4. **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions pipeline for build, lint, tests, deploy  
5. **SEO:** Metadata, Open Graph, structured data (JSON-LD)  
6. **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance  
7. **Analytics:** Google Analytics (GA4) or Plausible  
8. **Forms:** Contact form integrated with SendGrid or Netlify Forms  

## Design & UX
- Look and feel inspired by **Nexton.dev** and **Tecla.io**: clean, professional, tech-focused.  
- **Hero section** with clear value prop and a “Get in Touch” CTA.  
- **Services overview** using icons/cards.  
- **Why SnappyBits** or case-studies section.  
- **Team/About** snapshot.

## New Section: “Scale Your Team with LATAM’s Best Engineers”
- **Title:** “Scale Your Team with LATAM’s Best Engineers”

  - English-proficient,  
  - Time-zone friendly,  
  - Quick ramp-up  
- **CTA button:** “Get LATAM Talent”  
- **Optional:** Grid of sample candidate profiles or partner-country logos.
